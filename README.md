CrowdGame Trivially Pro - iOS App

CrowdGame Trivially Pro is an iOS app for the iPad that makes it easy to:
- Create and share single-user custom quizzes and contests
- Customize the appearance of your quiz, with your own logos, graphics, colors, fonts, and more

This repository contains the raw source code (in CoffeeScript: http://coffeescript.org/) of the app. 

We're sharing it here in the hopes that someone will find it helpful or interesting to browse the source code.

This repository doesn't contain all of the assets needed to recreate the app. For instance, none of the graphical assets are included, nor are the various config files required by Appcelerator (http://www.appcelerator.com/), the environment used to build the app.

The app was last successfully built and deployed as version 1.2.0 to the iOS App Store in March, 2015. Since then, there have been a number of changes to both the Appcelerator environment and iOS; as a result, the source code as it currently stands undoubtedly would need some modifications to bring it up to date and in compliance with the latest App Store requirements.

A note about the code: undoubtedly the code (style, algorithms, approach to abstraction, and so on) could be viewed as lacking in many, many ways. The app was built as a learning experience, and while we had a lot of fun in the process, there are lots of things we'd differently a second time around. 

Please also see the repository for a related app, CrowdGame Trivially, which offers multi-user play capabilities.

Enjoy!
